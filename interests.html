            <p>I throughouly enjoy being with my daughter Adrianna and my family. My hobbies include reading novels, going to the gym and the beach when I have free time on my hands. I think these hobbies offer a wonderful stress relief when needed. There is a much added perk when you live ten minutes from the beach as well!</p>
            <p>After having started the CTAC program, my interests in the software development technology field has expanded exponentially. I am especially interested in the fields of data analyst positions and DevOpps (Development and Operations). As an individual that likes to problem solve and partake in critical thinking, I would like to apply these hard skills into these positions that would ultimately make me successful.</p>
            <p>During further research on these topics, data anaylitics and DevOpps can also work similarily in the software development process, making them compatible in roles which can expand my career even further. </p>
