        <a href="https://github.com/lexigilley99/RepoGroup.git">RepoGroup</a>
        <p> This highlighted project was done as a group. The focus of this project was to work together to create a singular repo amongst team members that were also working on the branch. This project emphasized the importance of commmunication, merging, and pushing your local code into a remote code.</p>

        <ol>2. My Favorite Recipe</ol>
        <br>
        <a href="https://github.com/lexigilley99/MyFavRecipe.git">MyFavRecipe</a>
        <p>This highlighted project was an individual assessment where the expectation was to create a website about your favorite recipe. I choose chicken carbonara, with a rustic Italian color scheme featuring: a home page, directions, ingrediants, and a contact form.</p>
        <ol>3. ChatGPT</ol>
        <br>
        <a href="https://github.com/lexigilley99/ChatGPT.git">ChatGPT</a>
        <p>This highlighted project was an individual assessment that focused on creating a home page for a website that was centered on an specific prompt of your choosing that was created with ChatGPT. The prompt and theme I chose was centered about ocean pollution awareness.</p>
